# Krypto
This app is made by mainly using Python, yfinance and streamlit.
The app has two different main functions:
    - make a 5 days prediction for each of my own crypto currency  
    - compares my own crypto currencies with OMX (Stockholm stock market) 
    
This repo is used for development and to deploy the app at streamlit cloud
